**This repo is supposed to used as config by NvChad users!**

- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules , like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)

1) Lazyvim starter https://github.com/LazyVim/starter as nvchad's starcer was inspired by Lazyvim's . It made a lot of things easier!

This is the initial setup of NeoVim/NVChad. Daily updates will be made to nv-mods-backup and when a section of updates is completed and stable, nv-mods will be updated to ensure that a styabel backup is available as modifications contiue to be make can saved in nv-mods-backup. That all modifications are completed and found stable, then main will be updagted along with nv-mods so that there is both an incremental stable version of hte modifications and a long terms stable version of the modifications, whereas nv-mods-backup will house daily changes that are not yet considered comnplete and or stable.``
